					<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 10px;">Manicure</h3>


					<p>A manicure is a cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands performed at home or in a nail salon. It consists of filing and shaping the free edge, pushing and clipping (with a cuticle pusher and cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue (but limited to the cuticle and hangnails), treatments with various liquids, massage of the hand, and the application of fingernail polish.</p>
					<br>


					<p>Some manicures include painting pictures or designs on the nails, or applying small decals or imitation jewels. Other nail treatments may include the application of artificial gel nails, tips, or acrylics, which may be referred to as French manicures. In many areas, manicurists are licensed and follow regulations. Since skin is manipulated and is sometimes trimmed, there is a risk of spreading infection when tools are used across many people. Therefore, having proper sanitation can be a serious issue.</p>

				</div>


				<div class="nailsDialog" id="pedicureDialog">
					<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 10px;">Pedicure</h3>


					<p>A pedicure is a cosmetic treatment of the feet and toenails, analogous to a manicure. Pedicures are done for cosmetic, therapeutic purposes. They are popular throughout the world, and especially among women. Pedicures include care not only for the toenails; dead skin cells are rubbed off the bottom of the feet using a rough stone (often a pumice stone). Skin care is often provided up to the knee, including granular exfoliation, moisturizing, and massage. The word pedicure is derived from the Latin words pedis, which means "of the foot", and cura, which means "care".</p>
					<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicure  -->
				</div>


				<div class="nailsDialog" id="gelsDialog">
					<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 10px;">Gel Nails</h3>


					<p>There are two types of gel, hard gel and soft gel. Hard gel gets its name because, once cured, it is tough enough to be made into a nail extension. Nail extensions are artificial nails created by using a nail product to extend the nail past the edge of the natural nail. Soft gel refers to the gel products that are too soft to create a nail extension. This includes gel polishes and thicker gels meant for gel-overlay services.</p>
					<br>


					<p>Gel polishes are used for the increasingly popular gel polish manicures. These manicures, when done by caring, experienced, and trained professionals, are gentle to the natural nail and the polish stays intact on the nail for at least a couple of weeks with high shine and no cracking, peeling or chipping. The product used to create nail extensions using gel or gel nails is gel, not to be confused with acrylic nails, which are created using liquid monomer and polymer powder. All gel services are performed using some form of gel, which usually comes in pots of gel or bottles of gel polish. Gel also comes in a variety of colors. All forms of gel require curing, or hardening, under a UV (ultraviolet) light, which can be either a conventional bulb or LED lamp.</p>
					<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_nails  -->
				</div>


				<div class="nailsDialog" id="acrylicDialog">
					<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 10px;">Acrylic Nails</h3>


					<p>Acrylic nails are a more common form of artificial nails and may also be referred to as "liquid and powder nails". They have been around for decades whereas gel nail products are still a very recent addition to the nail industry. The most popular acrylic nail service is the pink and white which refers to the use of pink colored acrylic and a white acrylic powder to create a long-lasting French manicure look. Just as with gel nails, acrylic nail extensions can be created using forms to create sculpted nails or tips.</p>
					<br>


					<p>Forms are special stickers that are placed at the end of each finger, under the finger nail, and secured in place so that wet acrylic can be sculpted into a nail extension at the fingernail's edge. Thus, each nail extension is sculpted and why this procedure is referred to as "sculpts" or "sculpted nails." Tips are simply mass-produced plastic nail tips that are adhered to the fingernail's edge using nail resin. Each tip is clipped and filed into shape before applying the wet acrylic and the nail extension is made.</p>

				<div class="nailsDialog" id="nailartsDialog">
					<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 10px;">Nail Art</h3>


					<p>The nail care industry has been growing like never before ever since the invention of modern nail polish. In 2012, the United States witnessed a surging popularity of nail art. In the same year, a short nail art documentary was released: "NAILgasm". The film explored the growing trend of nail art; from women across the world to high fashion runways.</p>
					<br>


					<p>In 2014, Nailpolis.com, the online Museum of Nail Art was founded for nail artists and hobbyists to share their designs. It is free to visit this website, however, only members of Nailpolis are allowed to share their art. Women commonly use Youtube and Pinterest to learn how to do the newest and most interesting designs at home.</p>
