This is a website I made for the unit "Internet Interactivity', as part of my Digital Design Degree. The focus was to include meaningful user-friendly interactions that add vallue to the company.

There were no requirements for reponsive design for this unit, however, I am in the progress of adapting it to work on multiple platforms. Please view it here http://nails.soniaparker.net/

NOTE: currently non-responsive, progressing to responsive design
